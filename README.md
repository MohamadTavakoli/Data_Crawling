# Data_Crawling
In another project, I tackled the task of data extraction from an Iranian capital market's financial information website. Manual extraction wasn't feasible due to the sheer volume of over 4000 Excel files to be downloaded. To address this challenge, I developed a script that automated the process by accessing the designated website, navigating to the investment funds' pages, and downloading their monthly financial statements based on a provided list.
